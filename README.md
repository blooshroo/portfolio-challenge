# portfolio-challenge

Second week coding bootcamp challenge; creating a professional profile webpage.

## Site Description

This is a webpage that will one day display my programming portfolio as well as contact details for prospective employers to see what I'm capable of and get in touch with me.

## What I Did

Jeez, struggled for WAY TOO LONG! Tinkered with making a responsive webpage for the first time. Played with CSS grids and positioning. Added a few of my own photos and links. Obviously being a 2-week-old baby programmer, I don't have much to display portfolio-wise, so included a link to my long-neglected website ClimbAfrica (which I must still build,) and a link to an article I wrote about (surprise, surprise) climbing! Just left other portfolio links blank for the time being. Also only noticed in a last reread of instructions for this assignment that portfolio links were meant to be on the photos themselves, as opposed to the labels. OOPS! Tinkered with moving the images to HTML and reformatting Vs wrapping the divs in anchor tags, but ultimately am exhausted and will have to leave them be for now. Please be kind, teach!

Learned so much; mainly that there is still SO MUCH left to learn. And also, to never leave homework to the last minute. ðŸ˜…
